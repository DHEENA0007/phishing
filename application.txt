Phishing Detection System (Email & SMS) – Web Application Draft

Backend: Python Django
Database: SQLite3
Frontend: React
Portal: User Portal Only (Self-Service Platform)

1. Project Overview

The Phishing Detection System is a web-based application that allows registered users to analyze suspicious emails and SMS messages to determine whether they are legitimate or phishing attempts.

The system is designed for:

Individuals

Small businesses

Students

Corporate employees

The application focuses on:

Manual message analysis

URL inspection

Sender verification checks

Domain validation

Message pattern evaluation

Risk scoring (Rule-Based, not AI-based)

No artificial intelligence or machine learning models are included. The detection engine is purely rule-based and logic-driven.

2. Application Objective

Help users identify phishing messages

Provide a risk score

Explain why a message is suspicious

Educate users about phishing patterns

Maintain history of analyzed messages
